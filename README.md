# Reddit_trained_chatbot
This is my attempt at making a chatbot with reddit conversational data.

chatbot_database.py creates a local database with all the reddit comments, create_training_data.py gets all the comments with replies and saves them to a txt file that maps one to one with the question and answer having the same line on the to and from files. I was going to get a cloud gpu to train a tensor flow nmt model, but I decided otherwise when I realised the data i had (2022-october comments) was around more than 10 million replies and answers. which would take more than a day in total to run and would cost me quite alot for this project. Instead i decieded i would prepare the data with create_training_data.py and chatbot_database.py (to make sure they work) then use DialoGPT (a pre trained reddit comment chatbot) to continue with my project. this may seem like a cop out, but it saves me time and money. if i had the time and money and i were to make my own model i would use https://github.com/daniel-kukiela/nmt-chatbot to get my nmt model to train it. This uses an encoder to tokenise the inputs of the model then we use word vectors to relate our words together. this is used to reward our model for 'translating' our input (in our case it stays in english). the data would then be sent to a Recurrent neural network with long short term memory (LSTM). the output of this network would be decoded back into words fo our final output.
